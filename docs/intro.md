# Welcome!

Welcome to Shadow's Dash docs!

On this website, you will find documentation about Shadow's Dash.

# Order Shadow's Dash
Shadow's Dash is not a free product. It is provided as a "SaaS" [_(**S**oftware **A**s **A** **S**ervice)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service), meaning that you just have to configure your DNS provider. Your instance is then hosted and protected by us. Backups are also made automatically and are included in your monthly payment.

3 tiers are available for purchase:
| Tier name               | Maximum amount of users | Access to all features | Price          | Link to order                                                               |

No restrictions on the features. Every plan has access to the API too.

# Configuration

After your order, you will receive by email a **configuration code** within 1-5 minutes.

Make sure you have a **valid email address** configured at https://order.ctrlalt.cat/settings.

This code allows you to configure your instance **once it's paid for**.

:::info

You need to **OWN** a domain name with access to **DNS records** before ordering Shadow's Dash, as you will have to configure a `CNAME` DNS record pointing to `proxy.shadowsdash.com`. If you use any kind of proxying service (such as **CloudFlare**), you need to DISABLE proxying.

:::

After paying for your instance at order.ctrlalt.cat, access your instance via the domain you've configured, and input the configuration code provided.
