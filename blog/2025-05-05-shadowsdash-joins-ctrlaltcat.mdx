## Shadow's Dash joins [Ctrl Alt Cat](https://ctrlalt.cat)!

I'm thrilled to announce that after two awesome years of running Shadow's Dash, I've officially registered my company in France **[Ctrl Alt Cat](https://ctrlalt.cat)**!

**Nothing changes for you**, except the fact that the management dashboard has moved from manage.shadowsdash.com to [order.ctrlalt.cat](https://order.ctrlalt.cat). This is where you'll manage your Shadow's Dash instances, but this will also be used in the future to sell other services.

This also means that better invoices are being generated in the PDF format, with more details on the company, as required by french law (loi n° 2019-1479 du 28 décembre 2019).

This gives me space to grow and finally be in the goods in terms of taxes & payment platforms.

This can only mean positive stuff for Shadow's Dash, and I can't wait to share new updates with you all.

Thanks for your support!
